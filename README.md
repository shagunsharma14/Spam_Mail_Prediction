# Spam_Mail_Prediction

This repository contains the code and resources for the "Spam Mail Prediction" project, which focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether an email is spam or not based on its content.

## Project Overview

The objective of the "Spam Mail Prediction" project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify emails as spam or non-spam. By leveraging natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, the model analyzes the content of an email and assigns it a probability of being spam. This project aims to enhance email filtering systems and improve user experience by automatically identifying and filtering out unwanted spam emails.

## Usage

Open the Spam_Mail_Prediction.ipynb Jupyter Notebook file and follow the instructions provided. The notebook guides you through the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Load and preprocess the email dataset.
2. Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the email content.
3. Model Training: Train a machine learning model using the preprocessed data.
4. Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance and accuracy.
5. Prediction: Use the trained model to predict whether a new email is spam or not.

Each step is explained in detail within the notebook, making it easy to understand and reproduce the project's workflow.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Spam_Mail_Prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Spam_Mail_Prediction
```

3. Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to set up a virtual environment before installing the dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Open the Spam_Mail_Prediction.ipynb Jupyter Notebook using Jupyter or JupyterLab and execute the cells sequentially to run the project code.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the project code:

- Python (3.7+)
- Jupyter
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

You can install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure to customize the notebook as needed for your specific dataset and analysis requirements.
